#' Train models within a model grid
#'
#' The S3 method of the train function for the 'model_grid' class consolidates
#' all model (and training) configurations from a model grid and
#' trains them with the train function from the caret package.
#'
#' @param mg \code{model_grid}
#' @param train_all \code{logical} if set to TRUE, all models will be trained.
#' If set to FALSE, only models, for which no fit already exists, will be
#' trained.
#' @param resample_seed \code{integer} is used to create identical resamples
#' across models in order to obtain a fair (and reproducible) comparison of
#' the models. If set to NULL, seed will not be set (NOT advised).
#'
#' @return \code{model_grid} equipped with fitted models.
