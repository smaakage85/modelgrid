#' Pre-allocates an empty model grid
#'
#' Constructor function that pre-allocates an empty model grid.
#' The model grid  makes it easy to create, manage and train multiple caret models.
#' Define the settings that by default are to be shared by all of the models in
#' the model grid with \code{\link{share_settings}}. Add the individual
#' specifications for the models you want to investigate with \code{\link{add_model}}.
#' Train all of the models in the model grid with \code{\link{train}}.

#'  \code{\link{share_settings}} for how to define the shared settings of models
#'  within a model grid, \code{\link{consolidate_model}} for how to consolidate
#'  the shared settings of a model grid and the individual settings of a given
