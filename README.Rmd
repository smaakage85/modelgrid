This is a small package offering a minimalistic but flexible framework for 
creating, managing and training multiple caret models with a bare minimum of code.

## Installation

`modelgrid` can be installed from CRAN with ~~`install.packages('modelgrid')`~~ (soon). 
If you want the development version then install directly from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("smaakage85/modelgrid")
```

## Building your first model grid

First, pre-allocate an empty model grid with the constructor function `model_grid`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(modelgrid)
mg <- model_grid()

mg
```

As you see, a `model_grid` has three components:

* `shared_settings`: settings to be shared across models. Obvious choices include
the target variable, features and resampling scheme.
* `models`: settings that uniquely identifies the indvidual models.
* `model_fits`: holds the fitted models, once the `model_grid` has been trained.

Next, decide what settings you want to be shared by the models constituting the
`model_grid`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
data(GermanCredit)

mg <-
  mg %>%
  share_settings(
    y = GermanCredit[["Class"]],
    x = GermanCredit %>% select(-Class),
    metric = "ROC",
    trControl = trainControl(
      method = "cv",
      number = 5,
      summaryFunction = twoClassSummary,
      classProbs = TRUE
      )
  )
```

Our first model candidate will be a simple Random Forest configuration.

```{r}
mg <-
  mg %>%
  add_model(
    model_name = "Funky Forest",
    method = "rf",
    tuneLength = 5
  )
```

Let us also give an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model a shot.

```{r}
mg <-
  mg %>%
  add_model(
    model_name = "Big Boost",
    method = "xgbTree",
    nthread = 8
  )
```

That's it. We are all set to train our first very own (extremely simple)
model grid.

```{r, message = FALSE}
mg <- train(mg)
```

Visualize performance statistics of final models.

```{r performance_bwplot}
mg$model_fits %>%
  resamples(.) %>%
  bwplot(.)
```
