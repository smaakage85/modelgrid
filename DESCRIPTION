Title: A Framework for Creating, Managing and Training Multiple Caret Models
Version: 0.9.0.0
Authors@R: person("Lars", "Kjeldgaard", email = "lars_kjeldgaard@hotmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A minimalistic but flexible framework that facilitates the creation,
    management and training of multiple 'caret' models. A model grid consists of
    two components: a set of settings that are shared by all models by default, 
    and specifications that apply only to the individual models. When the model
    grid is trained, model and training specifications are first consolidated
    from the shared and the model specific settings into complete 'caret' model
    configurations. These configurations are then trained with the famous 
    'train' function from the 'caret' package.
